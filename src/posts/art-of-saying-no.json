  "body": "<p> Learning to say <strong>no</strong> is one of the most powerful skills for protecting your time and mental energy. Yet, many of us struggle with it because we fear conflict or disappointing others. </p> <p> Try these polite but firm phrases: </p> <ul> <li>“I appreciate the offer, but I’ll have to pass.”</li> <li><em>“That doesn’t align with my current priorities.”</em></li> <li>“Let me think about it and get back to you.”</li> </ul> <p> <strong>Every ‘yes’ to something unimportant is a ‘no’ to something meaningful.</strong> Saying no is not selfish — it’s how you make space for what truly matters. </p>"
