Even a few minutes of mindfulness can improve focus and reduce stress. </p> <blockquote> “How you start your day is how you live your day.” — Louise Hay </blockquote> <p> Here are a few simple rituals you can try: </p> <ul> <li><em>Write down three things you're grateful for</em></li> <li>Stretch or move your body for 5–10 minutes</li> <li>Drink a glass of water before coffee or tea</li> </ul> <p> Consistency matters more than intensity. Don’t overcomplicate it — just pick <strong>one or two habits</strong> and stick with them for a week. You'll be surprised at how much calmer and clearer your mornings feel. </p>"
