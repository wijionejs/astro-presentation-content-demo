But research shows that <strong>multitasking is actually a productivity killer</strong>. </p> <blockquote> “You can do two things at once, but you can't focus effectively on two things at once.” — Gary Keller </blockquote> <p> Why is multitasking so problematic? </p> <ul> <li><em>It increases mental fatigue</em></li> <li>It causes more mistakes</li> <li>It takes longer to complete each task</li> </ul> <p> Instead, try <strong>single-tasking</strong>: focus on one thing, finish it, and move on. Your brain will thank you, and so will your to-do list. </p>"
