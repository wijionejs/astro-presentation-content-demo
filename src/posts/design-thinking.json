Using design thinking, you'd: </p> <ol> <li><strong>Empathize:</strong> Notice when and why clutter builds up.</li> <li><strong>Define:</strong> Clarify the core issue — is it lack of storage or bad layout?</li> <li><strong>Ideate:</strong> Brainstorm possible improvements without judgment.</li> <li><strong>Prototype:</strong> Try a quick fix like moving your shelf or re-labeling folders.</li> <li><strong>Test:</strong> Live with the change for a few days and reflect on the results.</li> </ol> <p> By <em>approaching problems as experiments</em>, you're more likely to find lasting solutions — and have fun along the way. </p>"
